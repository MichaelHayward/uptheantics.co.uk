				<div class="memberBio"><p>Luke Mallison is a stand-up, improviser and sketch performer originally from Essex, England. 
				He has supported reputable circuit names including Russell Howard and Nathan Caton whilst Broadway Baby have described 
				him as &#34;hilarious&#34;. Others would describe him as the &#34;only Luke in the group&#34; or &#34;that guy with the face&#34;. Only time

				of the group - both in years and time spent in it - he can act (sort of); he can improv (reasonably well); and he can sing and dance 
				(if you close your eyes and block your ears).</p>

				enjoyed performing onstage for many years. During her spare time, she is keen on musical composition, reading and preparing

				<div class="memberBio"><p>To the classically trained, Scott Wilson is the true &#39;triple threat&#39; of the group - he can act, sing and has a gun. 
				One of the founders of The Idle Playthings at Bath Spa University, most recently he&#39;s released a sitcom called <i>Frack Off</i> which he 
				wrote/directed/produced/bled for, and narrowly avoided being sued by Paul McCartney for the smutty Fringe show <i>The Dung Beatles</i>. He has 
				appeared on stage, screen and online - occasionally on purpose.</p>

				the WilBee Productions&#39; sitcom <i>Frack Off</i>, with a voyage to Edinburgh thrown in for good measure. There was also this one expedition to Ardingly,

				has involved playing &#39;Beatrice&#39; in <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, as well as various drunken Shakespearean scoundrels with the Gloucestershire 
				Youth Players at the RSC. Her attempts to locate Hogwarts have so far proven ineffectual. </p>

				<div class="memberBio"><p>Pete Jones claims to have been a comedian since birth; although the earlier years of his career were hampered by an inability to talk, 
				he has since mastered the ability to speak and any problems audiences now have with understanding him are usually down to a lack of punchlines or wit. He is a 
				veteran of two Edinburgh festival shows in 2014 and 2016, and has been performing now for several years, despite popular demand. </p>
